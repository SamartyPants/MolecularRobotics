	<description>Version 2.3.6.0
    This mod adds magic and class development to RimWorld.
	
A RimWorld of Magic adds 21 classes, each with unique abilities and play styles.
Classes are broken down into two arch-types - the fighter and the mage - each represented with common fantasy roles like priests and necromancers.

This mod also adds a robust set of supporting features such as enchantments, magical armor, weapons and artifacts, class agnostic spells, research trees, crafting tables, mythical creatures, portals, and more!

Hugslib and Jecstools must be loaded before this mod for it to work properly.
